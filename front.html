                <label>Chess has recently experienced a boom in the user base. With streaming chess being more popular than ever more and more people are looking into chess. I got into chess during this time period (most notably at the time of the first pogchamps tournament) and as a crucial feature of my journey into chess is the discovery of chess variants. One of these, more than any other, struck me the most: 4 player chess. Unfortunately, I have no friends willing to learn 4 player chess and the people on the internet scare me. As such I will make my own 4 player chess engine and GUI so that I can play against computers.</label>
