# 4ChessBot
With the popularity of Chess nowadays the servers are filled with even more players. Lichess and Chess.com have experienced a massive increase in the number of active users, yet this is not true for all areas of Chess, especially variants. As a result of the lower popularity and interest in 4-Chess, this application will allow users to play against a 4-Chess bot. This will also allow me to make a chess engine and learn some basic frontend and web app development. If you decide to check this out I thank you for taking the time.
